# Union of Intervals Analysis ðŸ“Š

This project implements a Python algorithm to analyze and compute the **union of intervals**.  
The goal is to understand the behavior of interval unions and evaluate their properties through various experiments and edge cases.

## ðŸ“Œ Features  
- Efficient calculation of union of intervals.  
- Handles overlapping and disjoint intervals.  
- Provides performance analysis and accuracy evaluation.  

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure  
- `intervals.py` - Contains the implementation of the union of intervals algorithm.  
- `assignment2.py` - Main script to run the analysis and print the results.  
- `docs/Results.md` - Contains a detailed analysis and explanation of the results.  

## ðŸš€ How to Run  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Union-of-Intervals.git
   cd Union-of-Intervals
